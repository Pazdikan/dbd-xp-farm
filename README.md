## How It Works
The script keeps your killer moving and doing their thing to look like a real player. Each killer has their own actions they'll use - this helps rack up those sweet bloodpoints while keeping everything looking normal. Of course, the script is also farming XP by just being in a game (1 second = 1 xp, cap at 10 minutes)

### Supported Killers
| Killer | Actions |
|--------|----------|
| TRAPPER | Placing and picking up traps |
| BLIGHT | Rushing |
| DOCTOR | Static blast and therapy shock |

## Setup Guide

Please follow [the installation guide](GUIDE.md).

### Configuration
Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000` to customize script settings.

You can also access the web interface from a different machine, at `http://your-pc-local-ip:5000`
