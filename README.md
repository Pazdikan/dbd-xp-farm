## Key Features
- ‚ú® **Anti-AFK System**: Smart movement patterns to prevent disconnection
- üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Ban Protection**: Handles disconnections and loading screen issues
- üéÆ **Killer-Specific Actions**: Optimized behaviors for bloodpoint farming

## How It Works
The script keeps your killer moving and doing their thing to look like a real player. Each killer has their own actions they'll use - this helps rack up those sweet bloodpoints while keeping everything looking normal.

### Supported Killers
| Killer | Actions |
|--------|----------|
| TRAPPER | Trap placement and collection |
| BLIGHT | Rush ability utilization |

Note: The script uses isolated virtual environments to prevent Python package conflicts.
