## How It Works
The script keeps your killer moving and doing their thing to look like a real player. Each killer has their own actions they'll use - this helps rack up those sweet bloodpoints while keeping everything looking normal. Of course, the script is also farming XP by just being in a game (1 second = 1 xp, cap at 10 minutes)

### Supported Killers
| Killer | Actions |
|--------|----------|
| TRAPPER | Placing and picking up traps |
| BLIGHT | Rushing |
| DOCTOR | Static blast and therapy shock |

While AFK farming hasn't led to widespread bans and can benefit other players through gameplay mechanics, use this script at your own risk. The developer assumes no responsibility for any potential account actions.

Note: The script uses isolated virtual environments to prevent Python package conflicts.
