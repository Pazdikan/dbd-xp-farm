# Dead by Daylight XP Farm

In DBD you get 1 XP per second capped at 10 minutes, so this script will get you around 4950 XP per hour (during my tests).

Remember that you can get banned even thought I haven't heard about AFK bans.

## Warnings 
**[!] This script may not work with your monitor! You can open `screenshot.png` file and change values at line 39.**

**[!] You can't use your pc while using this script! The game has to be focused.**
