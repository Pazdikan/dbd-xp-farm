- gui app (overlayed above game windows?)
- if entire app cant be overlayed, overlay only logs and stats

- add to readme: cuda and pytorch installation

- network error still not fixed. possible fix:  run ocr in the middle of the screen and if text detected, click through all possible "ok" button positions (player disconnected, network error, and some other error)
